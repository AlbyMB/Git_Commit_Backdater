# Git_Commit_Backdater

Git Commit Backdater is a Python script that helps students and developers upload old projects or coursework to GitHub with accurate commit history. The script initializes a Git repository, commits files based on their last modified dates, and creates a corresponding GitHub repository, ensuring that your GitHub contribution chart reflects your historical work.
Features

    Folder Selection: A user-friendly file chooser to select the project folder.
    GitHub Repository Creation: Automatically creates a new GitHub repository with a specified name (default: folder name).
    Commit History Backdating: Commits files with their last modified dates.
    Git Repository Reset: Prompts to reset existing repositories if a .git folder is found.
    GitHub API Key Input: User inputs their API key securely for GitHub integration.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.6+
    Git installed on your system.
    PyGithub library installed:

    pip install PyGithub  

    A GitHub account with a Personal Access Token.

Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone <repository_url>  

Install required Python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt  

Usage

    Run the script:

    python github_commit_backdate.py  

    Choose a Folder: Use the file chooser to select the folder to backdate.
    GitHub API Key: Enter your GitHub API key (Personal Access Token).
    Repository Name: Enter a name for the GitHub repository (or press Enter to default to the folder name).
    The script will:
        Initialize or reset the Git repository in the folder.
        Commit each file with its last modified date as the commit date.
        Create a GitHub repository and push the commits.

Notes

    Reset Confirmation: The script automatically deletes existing .git folders without confirmationâ€”use cautiously.
    Error Handling: Errors (e.g., API or subprocess failures) are displayed in the terminal.
    Dependencies: Ensure shutil and os are compatible with your Python version.
